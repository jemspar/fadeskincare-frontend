      <strong>ACCEPTED METHODS OF PAYMENT AT FADESKINCARE.CO:</strong>  All prices are listed in USD, but may be paid for in BTC or XRP. All major credit cards are accepted via PayPal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ORDER PROCESSING:</strong> FADE is an intentionally small-scale operation -- I produce in small batches to provide the freshest product possible, and my assistant is largely responsible for packing and shipping all orders. Please allow an average of 2 – 5 business days to us prepare your order for shipment. From time to time, especially during busy holiday periods, after a temporary lab closure, or if there has been an unexpectedly high volume of orders for any other reason, your order may exceed this time frame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING:</strong> FADE ships via USPS, and for small orders this means we ship First-Class without tracking. If you live in San Francisco, you will automatically receive free "shipping," meaning I will personally drop off your order to the address you provide.
<p>Additional insurance, if required, is the responsibility of the buyer in the case of all carriers — please enquire for pricing. FADE is not responsible for parcels lost by USPS, and therefore only provides refunds or re-shipment in cases where the shipping carrier's insurance program successfully awards a claim as per their fraud prevention policies.  </p>
<p>Further regarding addresses, we can only ship to the address provided, and can not be responsible for any typographical errors including incorrect/incomplete zip codes, or missing apartment/unit/floor numbers, etc. An incorrect address may cause delays in shipping or parcel returns. Undeliverable USPS orders are directed to our international shipping partner in North Dakota and do not constitute return to FADE in Canada. Costs associated with incorrect shipping information is the responsibility of the buyer. If you have accidentally entered the wrong shipping address when placing an order, please get in touch within 24 hours of your purchase so we can make a change on your behalf before your parcel is packed for shipping. Thank you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RETURNS/EXCHANGES: </strong>If you experience a problem with your order, please contact me (jeremy@fadeskincare.co) to discuss an equitable solution.</p>
<p>Please note that in the event of a refund, the customer is responsible for return shipping.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT ACCURACY:</strong> FADE attempts to be as accurate as possible when describing and representing products online. However, FADE does not warrant that the product descriptions, images, colours, or other content on our site is complete, accurate, reliable, and current or error free. Please note that the colour calibration of different devices/monitors may vary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PRICING: </strong>FADE strives to make natural skin care options as affordable as possible and thus offers pricing that benefits a wide range of customers. The lowest available price is obtained through direct purchase from FADE — think of it as “factory direct”, “manufacturer pricing” or “public wholesale”. Any and all prices, whether online or in-store, are subject to change without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCT SAFETY: </strong>Just the Good’s all natural skin care products have been tested extensively by me, my friends, and an array of clients but I ask that you still use the same precautions you would with any other new skin care product. Please read ingredient labels thoroughly if you have any allergy concerns or other types of sensitivity. If redness, rash or irritation occurs, immediately discontinue use of product and/or consult your physician or dermatologist.</p>
<p>Please note that some essential oils can be quite potent and that, even in small quantities, it is often recommended that they be avoided by children and during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. The same is likewise true if you are nursing, have heart disease, high blood pressure, epilepsy, diabetes, or any other health conditions — please seek the medical advice of your health care professional before using FADE products.</p>
